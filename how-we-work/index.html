      <h1>How We Work</h1>

      <p>
        We don’t “guess” faults and write them up later. We inspect properly on site, log findings as they happen, and back it up with
        photographic and video evidence. What we see is what gets recorded.
      </p>

      <h2>1) We arrive ready (not unprepared)</h2>
      <p>
        Before we touch anything, we confirm the job details, the appliance type, the reported issue, and the location setup. That keeps the
        visit focused and avoids time-wasting.
      </p>

      <h2>2) We inspect first, then explain</h2>
      <p>
        We check installation quality, ventilation where relevant, appliance operation, and safety-critical items before giving conclusions.
        Decisions are based on evidence, not assumptions.
      </p>

      <h2>3) Live on-site reporting (the “SEO tool” you meant)</h2>
      <p>
        This is the key difference: we produce a clear, structured digital report while we’re there. Measurements, observations and safety
        concerns are logged at the point they’re identified, creating an accurate audit trail.
      </p>

      <h2>4) Photo &amp; video evidence</h2>
      <p>
        We capture photographs and short video clips to show appliance condition, installation defects, and safety issues clearly. This removes
        ambiguity and helps you make decisions with confidence.
      </p>

      <h2>5) Clear safety decisions</h2>
      <p>
        If a situation is unsafe, we explain what it is, why it matters, and what options exist. Where applicable, we issue the correct warning
        documentation and record the reasons clearly in the report.
      </p>

      <h2>6) Proper records, not paperwork</h2>
      <p>
        Reports are issued promptly and kept as a reliable record for servicing history, compliance, landlord documentation, and future
        decision-making.
      </p>

      <h2>Why this matters</h2>
      <p>
        An evidence-led process reduces missed defects, prevents disputes, and protects occupants. It also means if you need to share findings
        with an insurer, landlord, letting agent, or contractor, you’ve got clear proof.
